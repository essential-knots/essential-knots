### Essential Knots

Hi!  This will be a little repo to document what I consider are some "essential knots".  I plan to add image based guides to tying each of them, but for now just a simple list:

- alpine butterfly
- anchor hitch
- blake's hitch
- clove hitch
- double bowline (with Yosemite finish)
- double constrictor
- buntline (traditional and slipped)
